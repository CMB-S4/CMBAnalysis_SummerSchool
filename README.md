# CMBAnalysis_SummerSchool

These are lectures/workbooks are based on a notebook Jeff McMahon first prepared for the 2015 La Serena data science scummer school and were addapted and expanded for the CMB Analysis Summer School held at the University of Michigan, August 29-30 2016 by Renee Hlozek and Jeff McMahon with Sigurd Naess conntributing a notebook on Mapmaking.  The notebooks are based on the Anaconda distribution of python 3 which can be downloaded here:  https://www.anaconda.com.  We have made every effort to user as few specialized libraries as possible.  Thoough this was not possible for the excercise on liklihoods.
